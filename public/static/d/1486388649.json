I absolutely loved my entire experience and she took such great care of me and got my hair white girl straight which NEVER happens. I'm in love with it and glad to have someone amazing that will be helping me while I work on getting my hair back to it's beautiful and original state. It's smooth and feels amazing.

Christen has done my cuts the last couple times. I have never in my life had such a symmetrical cut in my life! The first cut was when I went in on a whim, after a bad day in June. I had bright red hair down to my waist. We cut off almost 16 inches into a super cute little above the shoulders bob. ï¿½ I went back for a trim yesterday and decided to get a cross between a stacked bob and a 'mom bob' up to my chin. The shop is always clean and I've always received top notch service. So if you want mediocre go anyway you want, if you want THE BEST haircut or color EVER!!! Go to Cassie Christen and Cali at Shear Madness. You'll be mad you went anywhere but to them!!!","image":"reviewer_jennifer_james.jpg"}},{"node":{"name":"Kimberly Blake","review":"From nails being done on Friday in shop by Mackie to Cassandra and Christin coming to the cabin on Saturday. These ladies are awesome. Being a nervous bride they made me feel comfortable and relaxed. They all made me feel like a million bucks. I recommend them to anyone and everyone getting married anywhere within their area. I loved the attention. They gave me exactly what I asked for and were helpful in guiding me when I was unsure of what I wanted. They are very knowledgeable. Love you gals. Can't wait to see u all again. Thank you so very much for making me look so good for my wedding.

They were all so nice. They helped me get AMAZING HAIR. First off, my inspiration picture had a side sweep bang which I do not have. So I said I know you can't do the bang but....Cassandra said oh no. I will make you a bang! And she did they were fun to hang out with. Definitely a great start to the day when we were all so tired. I'd get my hair done here again if I lived out here! They really helped make my sisters wedding day a special one.","image":"reviewer_jordan_nicole.jpg"}},{"node":{"name":"Brittany Haun","review":"So so so pleased with my nails by Mackie! She really listened to what I wanted, took her time, and was so gentle. I left with exactly what I came in for. They are over a week old at this point and still look great! I've already recommended her to two other girls, who I'm sure will be just as happy with their nails as I was!","image":"reviewer_brittany_haun.jpg"}},{"node":{"name":"Whitney Young","review":"Kristen did an amazing job on my hair for my wedding day!
