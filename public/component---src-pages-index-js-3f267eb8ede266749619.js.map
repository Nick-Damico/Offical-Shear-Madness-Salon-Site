This is all done automatically and internally.\n   *\n   * Every definition will be added to a \"com.greensock\" global object (typically window, but if a window.GreenSockGlobals object is found,\n   * it will go there as of v1.7). For example, TweenLite will be found at window.com.greensock.TweenLite and since it's a global class that should be available anywhere,\n   * it is ALSO referenced at window.TweenLite. However some classes aren't considered global, like the base com.greensock.core.Animation class, so\n   * those will only be at the package like window.com.greensock.core.Animation. Again, if you define a GreenSockGlobals object on the window, everything\n   * gets tucked neatly inside there instead of on the window directly. This allows you to do advanced things like load multiple versions of GreenSock\n   * files and put them into distinct objects (imagine a banner ad uses a newer version but the main site uses an older one). In that case, you could\n   * sandbox the banner one like:\n   *\n   * <script>\n   *     var gs = window.GreenSockGlobals = {}; //the newer version we're about to load could now be referenced in a \"gs\" object, like gs.TweenLite.to(...). Use whatever alias you want as long as it's unique, \"gs\" or \"banner\" or whatever.\n   * </script>\n   * <script src=\"js/greensock/v1.7/TweenMax.js\"></script>\n   * <script>\n   *     window.GreenSockGlobals = window._gsQueue = window._gsDefine = null; //reset it back to null (along with the special _gsQueue variable) so that the next load of TweenMax affects the window and we can reference things directly like TweenLite.to(...)\n   * </script>\n   * <script src=\"js/greensock/v1.6/TweenMax.js\"></script>\n   * <script>\n   *     gs.TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.7\n   *     TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.6\n   * </script>\n   *\n   * @param {!string} ns The namespace of the class definition, leaving off \"com.greensock.\" as that's assumed. For example, \"TweenLite\" or \"plugins.CSSPlugin\" or \"easing.Back\".\n   * @param {!Array.<string>} dependencies An array of dependencies (described as their namespaces minus \"com.greensock.\" prefix). For example [\"TweenLite\",\"plugins.TweenPlugin\",\"core.Animation\"]\n   * @param {!function():Object} func The function that should be called and passed the resolved dependencies which will return the actual class for this definition.\n   * @param {boolean=} global If true, the class will be added to the global scope (typically window unless you define a window.GreenSockGlobals object)\n   */\n  Definition = function Definition(ns, dependencies, func, global) {\n    this.sc = _defLookup[ns] ? _defLookup[ns].sc : []; //subclasses\n\n    _defLookup[ns] = this;\n    this.gsClass = null;\n    this.func = func;\n    var _classes = [];\n\n    this.check = function (init) {\n      var i = dependencies.length,\n          missing = i,\n          cur,\n          a,\n          n,\n          cl;\n\n      while (--i > -1) {\n        if ((cur = _defLookup[dependencies[i]] || new Definition(dependencies[i], [])).gsClass) {\n          _classes[i] = cur.gsClass;\n          missing--;\n        } else if (init) {\n          cur.sc.push(this);\n        }\n      }\n\n      if (missing === 0 && func) {\n        a = (\"com.greensock.\" + ns).split(\".\");\n        n = a.pop();\n        cl = _namespace(a.join(\".\"))[n] = this.gsClass = func.apply(func, _classes); //exports to multiple environments\n\n        if (global) {\n          _globals[n] = _exports[n] = cl; //provides a way to avoid global namespace pollution.

Remember, we typically create a proxy object that has a bunch of uniquely-named properties that we feed to the sub-plugin and it does its magic normally, and then we must interpret those values and apply them to the css because often numbers must get combined/concatenated, suffixes added, etc. to work with css, like boxShadow could have 4 values plus a color.\n  _setPluginRatio = _internals._setPluginRatio = function (v) {\n    this.plugin.setRatio(v);\n    var d = this.data,\n        proxy = d.proxy,\n        mpt = d.firstMPT,\n        min = 0.000001,\n        val,\n        pt,\n        i,\n        str,\n        p;\n\n    while (mpt) {\n      val = proxy[mpt.v];\n\n      if (mpt.r) {\n        val = mpt.r(val);\n      } else if (val < min && val > -min) {\n        val = 0;\n      }\n\n      mpt.t[mpt.p] = val;\n      mpt = mpt._next;\n    }\n\n    if (d.autoRotate) {\n      d.autoRotate.rotation = d.mod ? d.mod.call(this._tween, proxy.rotation, this.t, this._tween) : proxy.rotation; //special case for ModifyPlugin to hook into an auto-rotating bezier\n    } //at the end, we must set the CSSPropTween's \"e\" (end) value dynamically here because that's what is used in the final setRatio() method.

For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n   * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n   *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n   * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n   *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n   *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n   *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n   *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n   *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n   * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n   * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n   * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n   * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n   * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n   * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n   * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n   * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n   * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority CSSPropTweens will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.\n   * @param {string=} b Beginning value.

You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.\n   *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.\n   *\n   * @param {Object} target object to be tweened\n   * @param {number} Duration in seconds (or frames for frames-based tweens)\n   * @param {Object} Object containing the end values, like {className:\"newClass\", ease:Linear.easeNone}\n   * @return {Array} An array of TweenLite instances\n   */\n\n\n  CSSPlugin.cascadeTo = function (target, duration, vars) {\n    var tween = TweenLite.to(target, duration, vars),\n        results = [tween],\n        b = [],\n        e = [],\n        targets = [],\n        _reservedProps = TweenLite._internals.reservedProps,\n        i,\n        difs,\n        p,\n        from;\n    target = tween._targets || tween.target;\n\n    _getChildStyles(target, b, targets);\n\n    tween.render(duration, true, true);\n\n    _getChildStyles(target, e);\n\n    tween.render(0, true, true);\n\n    tween._enabled(true);\n\n    i = targets.length;\n\n    while (--i > -1) {\n      difs = _cssDif(targets[i], b[i], e[i]);\n\n      if (difs.firstMPT) {\n        difs = difs.difs;\n\n        for (p in vars) {\n          if (_reservedProps[p]) {\n            difs[p] = vars[p];\n          }\n        }\n\n        from = {};\n\n        for (p in difs) {\n          from[p] = b[i][p];\n        }\n\n        results.push(TweenLite.fromTo(targets[i], duration, from, difs));\n      }\n    }\n\n    return results;\n  };\n\n  TweenPlugin.activate([CSSPlugin]);\n  return CSSPlugin;\n}, true);\n\nexport var CSSPlugin = globals.CSSPlugin;\nexport { CSSPlugin as default };","/*!\n * VERSION: 0.6.1\n * DATE: 2018-08-27\n * UPDATES AND DOCS AT: http://greensock.com\n *\n * @license Copyright (c) 2008-2019, GreenSock.
