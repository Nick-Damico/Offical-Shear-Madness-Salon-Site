# Shear Madness Beauty Salon

![Shear Madness Salon](./src/images/logo.svg)

I was approached with the task of helping the local beauty salon Shear Madness Beauty Salon, located in Sevierville, TN, with site rebranding, logo design work, and photography. The company went through a difficult transition of websites, starting with an outdated Wordpress site that was no longer able to be maintained, and then a temporary site that didn't match their brand or capture the feel of their new salon location.

Through a series of meetings, we addressed their concerns of building a site that better captured the feel of there business and salons esthetics, to improve SEO, display data such as customer reviews and images, and have a site that instilled confidence in potential customers they were the best choice in the area.
